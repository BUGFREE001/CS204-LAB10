The difference is :

In w+ mode, If the file doesn't exist, it will create a new one.
Also, it truncates the file to zero length if it exists.

In r+ mode, If the file doesn't exist, it will not create a new one. It gives us an error.
If the file exists, it will append it to the end.


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
FILE *fp;
// open file in w+ mode  
fp = fopen("xyz.txt", "w+");
// write to the file
fprintf(fp, "This is testing for fprintf...\n");

// close the file
fclose(fp);
}
